Intro to C and Linux
====================

Part 1: Your terminal and you
-----------------------------

### Opening a terminal window

There are seveal ways to open a new terminal window:
 - [check Ubuntu menu]
 - Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

From the terminal we can much more than with the graphical interface, but we will start with some basic and familiar functions. First, we should make a new folder that we will use as our "workbench" of sorts.

 - To make this folder on the desktop, we must first change directory in the terminal. Do this by typing `cd ~/Desktop` ("cd" means "change directory"). Use the Tab key to autocomplete the directory name.
 - Make a new directory using `mkdir directoryName`. Give this some appropriate name.

We can create new files using `touch fileName`, and edit them using - for example - `nano` or `vi`. There are of course other non-terminal text editors, and these may be more (or less) comfortable to work with. Create a file.

 - We can list the files in the current directory by using `ls` ("ls" means "list").
   - If you call `ls -a`, you will see two extra entries: `.` and `..`. These are the "names" of the current directory and the parent directory, respectively. You can `cd` a level "up" by calling `cd ..`.
 - We can move a file using `mv moveThisFile toHere`. Move the file you created one level up, by calling `mv fileYouCreated ../fileName`, or the shorter version `mv fileYouCreated ../` if you want to keep the same fileName.
   - Call `ls ..` to check that the file is moved.
 - Similarly to `mv`, we also have `cp` for copying.
 - We can remove files using `rm`. Remove the file you created, moved (and any copies you created if you also copied it).

`mv`, `cp` and `rm` all have their own set of options. You can see what these are by calling eg `rm --help`. For `cp` and `rm`, we see that we need to use the option `-r` or `--recursive` to copy or remove folders.

If we want to select multiple files that match a certain pattern, we can use the wildcard `*`. For example, if we want to remove all files that end in `.txt`, we can call rm `*.txt`.
    
    
In the terminal, Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V do not perform copy/paste, and you can find a brief history as to why [here](http://superuser.com/a/421468). Instead, use `Ctrl + Shift + [C/V/X]`



Part 2: Ready, Set, C
---------------------

Before we create our first program in C, we must first look into exactly how we create it, how we run it, and finally - if it doesn't do this on its own - how we make it stop.

###Compilers for C

To create an executable program from C-code, we must compile it. There are several C-compilers out there, and the most common is by far Gnu Compiler Collection, [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/). [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) is a newer compiler, which means it has taken several lessons learned from gcc. One of the most noticeable improvements are the significantly superior warnings and error messages.

Compilers are complicated beasts, and have a [huge number of options](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Option-Summary.html). Here's a summary of the ones we will need:
 - `-o executableName`: By default, the name of the executable is `a.out`. `-o` gives it a different name.
 - `-c`: The compiler produces an object-file (.o) for each c-file, instead of a single executable.
   - This is used to prevent compiling all of the code over and over, when only a few files have been changed.
   - To create an executable from object files, use gcc or clang again, or call the linker directly using `ld`.
 - `-Wall`: There are lots of `-Wxx` options for controlling warnings. `-Wall` enables all of them.
   - In general, do not ignore compiler warnings because they're "just warnings"!
 - `-g`: Produces debugging information that will be useful if (also known as "when") your programs crash.
 - `-fsanitize=address`: This option will crash your program the moment Something Bad happenes with the memory the program is using, and print out a large amout of information about exactly what went wrong and - when used in combination with `-g` - where it happened.
 
###Running programs

To tell the terminal that we want to run a program, we must prefix the name of the executable with `./`, eg `./totallyRadProgram`. You can find an explanation of why [here](http://askubuntu.com/a/320657).

###Stopping program

As you may recall if you read the explanation for why copy/paste is done with Ctrl-Shift-C/V, Ctrl-C is used to cancel the current program.

Part 3: Hello World
-------------------

1: The standard hello world
    main function
        returns int
        optionally takes command line arguments (reading args later)
    printf
        newline
        included from standard library
        
2: With no #include
    [!] preprocessor
        [?] use -E
    implicit declaration is bad!
    default function is `int fcn(...)`
        which printf satisfies (fmt'ing later)
    [?] Add a forward declaration of printf
        
3: With no return value
    [!] language standards: c89, c99 (gnu99), c11
        in c89, return statement was mandatory
    using gcc c89:
        get return value with `echo $?`
        [?] what does it return?
            hint: what does printf return?
            [!] explanation of stack
            
4: The smallest C program?
    Same as before: default function is `int fcn(...)`
    

#5: The empty file
#    [!] Linker: Undefined reference
#    [!] Separate compile and link phase
#        [?] use -c
#        [?] link with ld, and define `--entry main`
#
    
    
Exercise 2 : Syntax
===================

1: Basic types
    int, double, char, void (more?)
1a: Modifiers
    *, static, const
    
2: printf
    format string, comma-separated arg list
     
3: Operators
    Arithmetic:
        Binary: + - * / % 
        Unary: ++ -- 
    Logical: < > && || ! 
    Bitwise: ~ & | ^ << >>
    Compound: op=
    
4: Functions
    [?] create a function that takes an integer and returns its square
    
5: Loops
    while, for, (do-while)
    [?] create a function that returns the n-th fibonacci number
    
6: If, modulo and printf formatting
    [?] Create a function that prints the Collatz sequence for a positive number
        Formatting: single line, columns 3 wide, left justify

7: User-defined types
    typedef
    structs
    [?] Create a struct
    [?] write a fake magic trick that modifies the struct content / creates a new struct
        [!] pointers, addrof (&), indirection/dereference (*)
    
8: Fixed-size arrays and basic pointer arithmetic
    [?] write a helper fcn that prints the array
        use array[indexing]
    [?] use sum += *p++ to foldl an array
    [?]Â call sort to sort an array
        [!] memory layout, object sizes, higher-order functions
    

Exercise 3 : Modules and Makefiles
==================================

1: {temp} Move some previous exercise to another file

2: {temp} Create a makefile (?)
